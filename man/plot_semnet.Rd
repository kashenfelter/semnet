\title{Visualize a semnet network}
\usage{
plot_semnet(g, weight_attr = "weight", minweight = NA,
  vertexsize_attr = "freq", vertexcolor_attr = NA, labelsize_coef = 1,
  labeldist_coef = 1.5, reduce_labeloverlap = T, redo_layout = F,
  return_graph = T, layout = layout_with_fr, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{A network in the igraph format. Specifically designed for the output of coOccurenceNetwork() and windowedCoOccurenceNetwork()}

\item{vertexsize_attr}{a character string indicating a vertex attribute that represents size. Default is 'freq', which is created in the coOccurenceNetwork functions to indicate the number of times a word occured.}

\item{vertexcolor_attr}{a character string indicating a vertex attribute that represents color. The attribute can also be a numeric value (e.g., a cluster membership) in which case colors are assigned to numbers.}

\item{labelsize_coef}{a coefficient for increasing or decreasing the size of the vertexlabel.}

\item{labeldist_coef}{a coefficient that roughly determines the minimal distance between vertex labels, based on the size of labels. Only used if reduce_labeloverlap is TRUE.}

\item{reduce_labeloverlap}{if TRUE, an algorithm is used to reduce overlap as best as possible.}

\item{redo_layout}{If TRUE, a new layout will be calculated using layout_with_fr(). If g does not have a layout attribute (g$layout), a new layout is automatically calculated.}

\item{return_graph}{if TRUE, plot_semnet() also returns the graph object with the attributes and layout as shown in the plot.}

\item{...}{additional arguments are passed on to plot.igraph()}
}
\value{
Plots a network, and returns the network object if return_graph is TRUE.
}
\description{
plot_semnet is a wrapper for the plot.igraph() function optimized for plotting a network with vertex labels.
}
\details{
Before plotting the network, the setNetworkAttributes() function is used to set pretty defaults for plotting. Optionally, reduce_labeloverlap can be used to prevent labeloverlap (as much as possible).
